# Agendastats

This project was created to provide statistical insight into player performance within [Global Agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Agenda). Match results were uploaded as a table image, parsed via an OCR application (created by another player), and ingested into a PostgreSQL database.
